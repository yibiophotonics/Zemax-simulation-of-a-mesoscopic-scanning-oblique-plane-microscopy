# Zemax simulation of a mesoscopic scanning oblique plane microscopy
Ray tracing and analysis for both the excitation and emission light paths of our mesoscopic OPM are provided in the Zemax files. 

# Abstract
The recent development of oblique plane microscopy (OPM) simplifies Conventional light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) design with only one single objective lens, by using off-axis excitation and remote focusing.  However, most reports on OPM  has a limited microscopic field of view (FOV), typically within 1x1 mm2. Our goal is to overcome the limitation with a new variant of OPM to achieve mesoscopic FOV.  We implemented an optical design of mesoscopic scanning OPM to allow using low numerical aperture (NA) objective lens. The angle of the intermediate image before the remote focusing system was increased by a demagnification under Scheimpflug condition such that the light collecting efficiency in the remote focusing system was significantly improved.  We characterized the 3D resolutions and FOV by imaging fluorescence microspheres, and demonstrated the volumetric imaging on intact whole zebrafish larvae, mouse cortex, and multiple Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans).  We demonstrate a mesoscopic FOV up to ~6× 5×0.6 mm3 volumetric imaging, the largest reported FOV by OPM so far.  The angle of the intermediate image plane is independent of the magnification. As a result, the system is highly versatile, allowing simple switching between different objective lenses with low (10x, NA 0.3) and median NA (20x, NA 0.5).  Detailed microvasculature in zebrafish larvae, mouse cortex, and neurons in C. elegans are clearly visualized in 3D.
